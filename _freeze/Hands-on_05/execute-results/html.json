It is a continuation of Chapter 2. We assume that you already have Landsat 8 data set(s) downloaded. If you have yet to do so, please refer to [Chapter 2: Acquiring Landsat 8 Data](Hands-on_01.html) to download a Landsat 8 data set of an area of interest.\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will acquire the skills to:\n\n-   extract subset from a complete scene,\n-   enhance individual band for clearer visualisation,\n-   create composite images by using multiple bands for visual interpretation,\n-   compute vegetation indices for land cover analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
