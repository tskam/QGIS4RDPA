There are several ways to download Sentinel-2 data including using a QGIS plugion. In this chapter, you will learn how to use interfaces provided by [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) to :\n\n-   search for area of interest,\n-   define area of interest,\n-   define specific data extraction criteria, and\n-   download select data.\n\n## Register and create a user account with Copernicus\n\n-   First, let us visit website by click on this [url](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).\n\nCopernicus Open Access Hub website appears on your default web browser as shown be below.\n\n![](img02/image0.jpg)\n\n-   Click on COPERNICUS BROWSER button located on the right of the page.\n\nYour browser should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img02/image1.jpg)\n\n-   Click on **Login** button\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img02/image2.jpg)\n\n-   Click on **Register** button.\n\nA new window open on your web browser.\n\n![](img02/image3.jpg)\n\n-   Complete the form by providing the necessary information.\n\n-   Click on REGISTER button located at the end of of the page.\n\nWithin a second, you will receive a e-mail from Copernicus requesting you to validate your email. Complete the validation by responding to the e-mail.\n\nNow, you are ready to download Sentinel-2 data from Copernicus Browser.\n\nNote: Before moving to next step, it is advisable to bookmark this page because we you visit the page very often.\n\n### Step 1: Select area of interest\n\nThe easiest way to define the area of interest is by zooming into your area of interest.\n\n-   Navigate and zoom into Singapore.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img02/image4.jpg)\n\nDifferent from EarthExplorer, Copernicus Browser uses Sentinel-2 Mosaic as the reference map. In fact, there are two reference maps, namely Sentinel-2 Mosaic and OSM.\n\n-   Click on **Map Layer** button located on the upper right of the view window.\n\n![](img02/image5.jpg){width=\"300\"}\n\n-   Feel free to change the reference map by clicking on any one of them.\n\nNext, we will select the area of interest.\n\n-   From the view window, click on **Area mode** button.\n\n![![](images/clipboard-150407189.jpeg){width=\"350\"}](img02/image6.jpg){width=\"59\"}\n\n-   Position the mouse at the upper left corner of Singapore island.\n\n-   Press of left button of the mouse, then drape to form a window as show on the screenshot below.\n\n![](img02/image7.jpg)\n\n-   Release the mouse.\n\nNotice that the area of interest has been locked.\n\n![](img02/image8.jpg)\n\n### Step 2: Specifying search criteria\n\nNext, we will specify the search criteria.\n\n-   Click on the **Search** button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n-   Click on the check-box in front of SENTINEL-2.\n\n![](img02/image9.jpg){width=\"350\"}\n\nLet say we are interested to find Sentinel-2 data sets for the year 2024.\n\nScroll down to **Time Range** pane and change time range as shown below.\n\n![](img02/image10.jpg){width=\"350\"}\n\n-   When you are ready, click on the **Search**.\n\n-   Lastly, click on **Search** button to start the search.\n\nBe patient, it will take a while to search the entire archieve.\n\nAWhen the search completed, the search results will be display on the left pane as shown on the screenshot below.\n\n![](img02/image14.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\nThe list shows that there a total of 150 scenes meet the search criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Downloading a selected scene\n\nLet sat we are interested to download the scene taken on 2024/02/04.\n\n-   Navigate to the scene then click on **Product info** button.\n\n![](img02/image15.jpg)\n\nProduct info window appears.\n\n![](img02/image16.jpg)\n\n-   Scroll down to read the important information of the scene. For example, the report shows that the scene has relatively less cloud cover of 5.6%.\n\n-   When you are ready to download the data set, click on the **Close** button to close the window.\n\n-   At the left window, hover the mouse over the scene dated 2018/02/10. Click on **Download** button.\n\n![](img02/image17.jpg)\n\nA pop-up window appears informing us that the offline product retrieval had been initiated and we should check our Cart to know when it will be ready.\n\n![](img02/image18.jpg){width=\"274\"}\n\n-   Click on OK button to close the window.\n\nBe patient, the data size is very large and will take at least an hour to download.\n\n> Gentle reminder: The downloaded data will be in zip file format. You need to unzip the file. It is also a good practice to keep the downloaded files in the project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
