You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel as if you are in Google Maps. Google street view is also enabled, where you can drop a marker and get a real view of the location.\nBefore getting started, it is always a good practice to click on Clear Search Criteria in order to clear away all the previous search criteria.\nIn order to download Landsat 8 data from USGS Earth Explorer, here are the four steps you’ll need to follow:\n\n2.2.1 Step 1. Set your area of interest in the “Search Criteria” tab\nThe easiest way to define the area of interest is by zooming into your area of interest.\n\nNavigate and zoom into Singapore.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nOnce you have confirmed the area of interest,\n\nScroll downward until you see Use Map button appears on the left panel.\n\n\n\nClick on Use Map button.\n\nNotice that the selected area of interest appears red and the four corner coordinates are displayed on the left panel.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Step 2. Select your data to download in the “Data Sets” tab\nNext, we are going to select the data set.\n\nScroll down until the end of the page, click on Data Sets button.\n\n\nThe available data sets list appears on the left panel as shown below.\n\nUSGS Earth Explorer provides a comprehensive remote sensing datasets: aerial imagery, AVHRR, commercial imagery, digital elevation models, Landsat, LiDAR, MODIS, Radar, and more. We are interested on Landsat 8 data.\n\nFrom the list, click on the check-box in front of Landsat -> Landsat Collection 2 Level 1 -> Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS C2L1.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Step 3. Filter your data in the “Additional Criteria” tab\nNext, we will define additional search criteria.\n\nFrom the left panel, click on Additional Criteria button.\n\n\nIn general, we would like to select a cloud free Landsat 8 data. However, it is almost impossible to obtain a cloud free data sets. To be reality, a search criterion of 10-15% land cloud cover will be used.\n\nFrom the left panel, click on the cross button at the back of Land Cloud Cover.\nType 5 to 15. This mean we would like to narrow the search to 5-15% land cloud cover.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Step 4. Download free Landsat imagery in the “Results” tab usgs earth explorer results\nNow, we are ready to download the select data sets. However, before we do so, it is a best practice for us to do a quick view of the data sets meeting our search criteria.\n\nFrom the left panel, click on Results button.\n\nA list of Landsat 8 data meeting the search criteria appears on the left panel.\n\nBefore downloading any of the data sets, it is important for us to examine the scene in order to ensure that they are indeed fall within our area of interest. For example if you click on the thumb image dated 2019/02/11, you will notice that it did not Singapore.\n\nAfter careful examination, let us down the data set acquired on 2018/05/24.\n\nFrom the data set pane, click on Download button.\n\n\nDownload Options window appears.\n\nSince we are going to use the data for image processing and analysis, we will download the Level 1 GeoTIFF data product.\n\nClick on the drop-down list of Product Options.\n\nProduct Download Options window appears.\n\n\nClick on the button in front of Landsat Collection 2 Level-1 Product Bundle.\n\nBe patient, the data size is very large and will take sometime to download.\n\n\nGentle reminder: The downloaded data will be in zip file format. You need to unzip the file. It is also a good practice to keep the downloaded files in the project folder."

For example, the report shows that the scene has relatively less cloud cover of 5.6%.\nWhen you are ready to download the data set, click on the Close button to close the window.\nAt the left window, hover the mouse over the scene dated 2018/02/10. Click on Download button.\n\n\nA pop-up window appears informing us that the offline product retrieval had been initiated and we should check our Cart to know when it will be ready.\n\n\nClick on OK button to close the window.\n\nBe patient, the data size is very large and will take at least an hour to download.\n\nGentle reminder: The downloaded data will be in zip file format.

The plugin requires the installation of GDAL, OGR, Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Some tools require also the installation of SNAP (ESA Sentinel Application Platform). For more information please visit https://fromgistors.blogspot.com .\n\nFrom the menu bar, click on Plugin -> Manage and Install Plugins.\n\n\nPlugins dialog window appears.\n\nAt the search, type Semi-Automatic.\n\nYou will see the plugin appears.\n\n\nClick on Install Plugin button to install the plugin.\n\nWhen the installation completed,\n\nclick on the Close button to close the dialog window.\n\nBy default, SCP tools menu and icons should appears on your QGIS.
